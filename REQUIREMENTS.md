Minimum requirements:

Create a basic react app that can be run locally and achieves the following requirements:

1. Implement routing and separate pages for

/dashboard (homepage)
Dashboard page should have a picture, a chart component (can be random data), and some random text

/profile
Profile page should have a picture and some details (can be hardcoded)

/table
a page with a table component containing random data

2. Implement a navigation header bar component that persists across all pages and allows the user to switch between pages (ie... switch between dashboard/profile/table)

*Note:

Use tailwind and the https://ui.shadcn.com/ for components and styling

the react app can use hardcoded data

Optional/above-and-beyond:

- implement additional pages of your choice

- aesthetic styling/UI

- create a backend web api and connect the frontend react app to it, pull data from the api instead of using random data (for charts/table/profile data)

- deploy the app to a free cloud host
